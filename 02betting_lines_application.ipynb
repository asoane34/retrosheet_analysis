    "The attempt to model baseball games with high accuracy has been a total failure so far. However, this may not mean there is not value to be discovered here. The methodology here will be simple: I will generate a model using a the dataset and building on the work of previous modeling notebook (see __01classification_win_loss.ipynb__) but instead of trying to accurately predict every game, I will look for games that have a higher probability of falling into a class (winning) with good value (a __+__ moneyline) and see if the model would have generated profit for a given season. The lesson here may be that there is no real value in trying to predict every game, but picking ones spots may be highly beneficial. "
